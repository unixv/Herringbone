# The Receiver

Collecting logs from applications and endpoints is easy with the receiver service.

#### Setup a receiver

Select a receiver type to fit your log collection needs

Receiver types:
- TCP
- UDP
- HTTP

The receiver type is set by the RECEIVER_TYPE environment variable of the application host. In the
example we use Docker to start up one UDP receiver container on port 7002.

```bash
docker run -p 7002:7002/udp -e RECEIVER_TYPE=UDP receiver:beta-1.0.0
```
The receiver container port is 7002 for all types.

**Note:** When using the HTTP receiver type the endpoint that receives data will be at http://HOST:PORT/receiver.

Add in Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling to your deployment and make it scalable! See the example below of
a more advanced real world UDP receiver deployment.
